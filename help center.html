    <b>Help</b><br>
    Helping users navigate our website should always be top priority. How easy or difficult it is for visitors to move around your website can severely impact their impression of you, your brand, or your product. Good website navigation is crucial for providing a positive user experience because it helps visitors find the information they are looking for without spending too much time clicking around. 
Now, let’s dive deep into the ins and outs of website navigation and explore how we can improve the navigation on our site.

<br>
<b>What is a website navigation system?</b>
<br>
A website navigation system encompasses the various menus, breadcrumbs, and internal links that allow users to access different sections and pages of a website. 
The complexity of the navigation system depends on the website's structure and the content the site offers its visitors. 
A good navigation system reduces bounce rate and optimizes page structure for both search engines and user experience.<br>
<b>Top menu</b>
<br>
The top menu is the primary website navigation bar that's located at the top of every page on a website. The top menu is a horizontal navigation that typically includes a site's logo and key navigation options. Large-scale websites like Amazon typically use top menus to provide comprehensive navigation for their site. 

<br>
<b>Footer menu</b><br>
It's considered good practice to add navigation links to the most important pages of a website in the footer of a webpage. 
Website visitors who scroll all the way to the bottom of the page can use links in a footer to navigate. Footer menus are also good for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because they build relevant links into pages throughout your site. 

<br>
<b>Sidebar</b><br>
Sidebar is a vertical menu positioned on either the left or right side of a page.This type of navigation is less frequently used than the top menu but can be seen on many sites such as the New York Times, 
where it’s used in conjunction with a top menu navigation system.
